<p><h1>Made poor by the rich</h1></p>

<p>How did it come that I got poor by money?</p>

<p>20 years ago I worked in the field of technical informatics on shopfloor wide automation systems and electronics, communication an so on. Originally I studied Mathematics and Physics in Zürich. One should think that it hardly can happen that one gets poor with this education. But that is by far not the case.</p><p>One good day,it was the 24. October 2003, I drove home by SBB-train after work. The train drove and drove.....   but then suddenly, at 17H45, a loud bang cracked through the wagon and I heared a loud crunching coming up from the train's wheels. It felt out of the wheels. For a short second I thought: "hopefully it will roll to a stop softly like an aircraft when landing". But this very moment I felt flying head in front towards the train's front wall. An hour later or so I layed in the hospital with some broken vertebra bones.</p>
